His experience, court craft, and formidable net play are unparalleled in this match. While Joao Fonseca is primarily a singles player and less experienced in doubles, his raw talent is high, and playing alongside a mentor like Melo in front of a home crowd in Rio will undoubtedly elevate his game. Robin Haase is a very capable and experienced doubles player with good results on clay, but his partner Constantin Frantzen primarily competes at the Challenger level. The combination of Melo's elite-level expertise, the home crowd advantage for the Brazilian duo, and the overall difference in doubles pedigree at the top level between Melo and Frantzen, tips the scales in favor of Fonseca/Melo."</em></p>

                        <p><em>"Jan-Lennard Struff is a seasoned veteran on the ATP tour with a powerful serve and forehand that are highly effective on hard courts. He has extensive experience in main draw matches at this level and consistently performs well against top competition. Otto Virtanen is a promising young player with a big game, but he is less experienced at the ATP main draw level. While Virtanen can certainly be dangerous, Struff's consistency, match toughness, and proven track record on hard courts give him a significant edge in this encounter."</em></p>

Her flat groundstrokes generate good pace and depth, making it difficult for opponents to dictate rallies. Coupled with a reliable serve and solid court coverage, she's well-equipped to manage the faster conditions of a hard court. While Chukwumelije Clarke may possess powerful strokes, Liutova's tactical consistency and experience on this surface are expected to give her the edge in extended exchanges, leading to fewer unforced errors and greater control over the match."</em></p>
