While he can be inconsistent, his peak level generally surpasses that of Alexis Galarneau. Galarneau is a solid and consistent player, but may struggle to consistently break Gojo's serve or withstand his offensive firepower. Gojo's experience on the ATP Tour and his ability to secure upsets against higher-ranked opponents suggest he has the weaponry to control this matchup."</em></p>
